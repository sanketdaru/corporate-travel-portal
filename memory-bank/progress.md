## Known Issues

### Build System

1. **Gradle Wrapper Upgraded**: Changed from 4.4.1 to 8.5
   - **Reason**: Old version incompatible with Java 17
   - **Impact**: All future builds will work correctly
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Shared Libraries

1. **Lombok Configuration**: Initially missing annotation processor
   - **Impact**: Build failures with @Data, @Builder annotations
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved in security-commons build.gradle

2. **SecurityConfig Bean Initialization**: JwtAuthenticationConverter not properly configured
   - **Impact**: Compilation errors
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved with proper @Bean method

### Domain Models

1. **BookingStatus Missing PENDING**: Enum didn't have PENDING state
   - **Impact**: Compilation error in BookingServiceImpl
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved - added PENDING to enum

### None Currently Outstanding

All infrastructure and services are working correctly.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Planning (Day 1)
- Decided on monorepo structure
- Chose Spring Boot for backend
- Selected Docker Compose for local development

### Design Refinements (Day 1)
- Added separate Approval Service (was originally embedded)
- Chose shadcn/ui over Material UI for frontend
- Deferred Vault to post-MVP
- Deferred Keycloak SPI to post-MVP

### Implementation Patterns Established
- Security pattern: JWT → SecurityContext → OPA → Business Logic
- Database pattern: Every table has tenant_id and user_id
- Audit pattern: Separate audit tables with actor/subject
- Service pattern: Controller → Service → Repository

### Best Practices Discovered
- Shared security library works very well
- OPA policy testing should be automated
- Documentation at multiple levels is valuable
- Setup scripts save significant time

## Next Milestone

**Goal**: Test Both Services and Implement Approval Service

**Deliverables**:
1. ✅ Travel Service implemented with full CRUD + OpenAPI
2. ✅ Expense Service implemented with workflow + OpenAPI
3. Test both services end-to-end with infrastructure
4. Implement Approval Service with workflow state machine
5. Integration testing with OPA authorization
6. Multi-tenant isolation verification

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours for testing + Approval Service

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Can create/read/update/delete bookings via REST API
- ✅ Can create/read/update/delete expenses via REST API
- ✅ Expense workflow (submit, approve, reject) implemented
- ✅ Both services have OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Cross-tenant access blocked by OPA (needs testing)
- Delegation flow works (Dave books for Carol) (needs testing)
- ✅ Expenses can reference bookings
- Both services running in Docker Compose (ready to test)

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term (Next 2-3 Weeks)
1. Complete all domain services
2. Implement BFF with token exchange
3. Create basic frontend with key flows
4. End-to-end demo scenarios working

### Medium Term (1-2 Months)
1. Add Keycloak SPI for token enrichment
2. Implement OpenTelemetry tracing
3. Add comprehensive test suite
4. Polish UI with better UX

### Long Term (3+ Months)
1. Kubernetes deployment
2. Service mesh integration
3. Vault for secret management
4. Production hardening
5. AI agent delegation patterns
